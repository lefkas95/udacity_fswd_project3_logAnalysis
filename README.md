# Log analysis tool

## Desription

This python program executes three SQL-queries against a postgresql database called news to answer the following questions:
* What are the most popular three articles of all time?
* Who are the most popular article authors of all time?
* On which days did more than 1% of requests lead to errors?

## Run it

To run the program call `python logAnalysis.py`

There must be an active postgresql database on the machine in order to work!
